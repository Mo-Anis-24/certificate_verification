# Admin System Setup Guide

## Overview
The certificate verification system now has a secure admin management system where:
- The first admin can register directly when no admin exists
- After the first admin is created, only existing admins can add new admins
- Default admin credentials have been removed for security

## Initial Setup

### Option 1: Fresh Installation (Recommended)
1. Delete the existing `instance/interns.db` file
2. Run the application: `python app.py`
3. Navigate to the login page
4. You'll see a "Register First Admin" button
5. Click it and create your first admin account
6. Login with your new credentials

### Option 2: Reset Existing Database
If you have an existing database with default admin accounts:
1. Run the reset script: `python reset_db.py`
2. Confirm the reset when prompted
3. Follow steps 3-6 from Option 1

## Admin Management

### Adding New Admins
1. Login as an existing admin
2. Go to "Choose Panel" â†’ "Admin Management"
3. Click "Add New Admin"
4. Fill in the username and password
5. Submit the form

### Deleting Admins
1. Go to Admin Management panel
2. Click "Delete" next to the admin you want to remove
3. Confirm the deletion
4. Note: You cannot delete your own account or the last admin

## Security Features
- Password confirmation required for all admin creation
- Username uniqueness enforced
- Cannot delete the last admin account
- Cannot delete your own account
- All admin operations require authentication

## File Structure
- `app.py` - Main application with admin routes
- `templates/admin_register.html` - First admin registration
- `templates/admin_management.html` - Admin management panel
- `templates/add_admin.html` - Add new admin form
- `reset_db.py` - Database reset utility

## Routes
- `/admin_register` - First admin registration (only accessible when no admin exists)
- `/admin_management` - Admin management panel (requires login)
- `/add_admin` - Add new admin form (requires login)
- `/delete_admin/<id>` - Delete admin (requires login)

## Troubleshooting
- If you get locked out, delete the database file and start fresh
